# Overview

An analysis and visualisation of CO2 emissions by various countries over the course of two decades (1994-2014), focusing on annual and total emissions.

# Files

**CO2** *(.pdf)* - A PDF with the main graphics on CO2 emissions, as well as some explanatory text and sources.

**CO2** *(.Rmd)* - The markdown file used to create the PDF output.

**CO2** *(.R)* - The R code used to prepare the data and create graphics.

**CO2Plots** *(.jpeg)* - A standalone image, embedded below, that shows the top 15 countries by total CO2 emissions from 1994 - 2014 as well as how their emissions change over time.

**EmissionsByCountry** *(.csv)* - Spreadsheet with carbon dioxide emissions by country, 1960 - 2014. For some countries, data is not available across the entire range of years. Data was obtained from the World Bank, and can be viewed and downloaded [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.KT?type=shaded&view=map&year=2014&year_high_desc=false).
