# Overview

This small project is a simple analysis of CO2 emissions by various countries over the course of two decades.

# Files

**EmissionsByCountry** - Spreadsheet with carbon dioxide emissions by country, 1960 - 2014. For some countries, data is not available across the entire range of years. Data was obtained from the World Bank, and can be viewed and downloaded [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.KT?type=shaded&view=map&year=2014&year_high_desc=false).

**CO2Plots** - The final result showing the top 15 countries by total CO2 emissions from 1994 - 2014 as well as how their emissions change over time.

**CO2** - The R code used to create the plots.
